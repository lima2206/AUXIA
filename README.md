## üèÖ Challenge <a id="challenge"></a>

The challenge consists of creating a web application for evaluating LLM responses. The application must allow sending a prompt to 2 (two) LLMs via API simultaneously. Next, the application must present the 2 (two) obtained responses. For each response, the application presents evaluation items, and finally, it presents a comparison scale of the two responses so that the user can define which response was better and justify it. All this information must be saved in a database that will serve for future retraining of the LLMs.

## üèÖ Solution <a id="solution"></a>

**AUXIA - Auxiliary AI Training** will allow users to send prompts to multiple AI models, compare their responses, evaluate each one according to objective criteria, choose the best response, and justify their decisions. This process will ensure efficient reinforcement learning, enabling the continuous improvement of the models used through the persisted evaluation data.
